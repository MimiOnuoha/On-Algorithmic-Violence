# Incomplete Reading List

Here are just a few of the texts that I'm drawing on in the piece. Where possible, I've put the readings in the folder, in other cases I've included a link.

I'm breaking all the rules by not doing this in any kind of order or formal citation style….but we're on Github, so if anyone wants to fix just submit a pull request. :)
